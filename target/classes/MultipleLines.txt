BERLIN — Nonagenarian survivors of Auschwitz, including two who recently met Pope Francis when he visited the former Nazi death camp, have asked Germany’s highest court to swiftly resolve the case of a former SS soldier who was convicted of complicity in the murder of 300,000 prisoners.
The German authorities have adopted a more aggressive approach to prosecuting those suspected of being Nazis, but “Auschwitz survivors do not have as much time as German justice,” said Roman Kent, 90, the New York-based president of the International Auschwitz Committee, a nongovernmental group that unites Holocaust survivors.
The former SS soldier, Oskar Gröning, now 95, was sentenced in July 2015 by a court in Lüneburg to four years in prison for accessory to murder while serving at Auschwitz, where he also confiscated money and jewels from arriving prisoners.
His lawyers and those representing some of the dozens of co-plaintiffs in the case appealed the decision, but the time needed to address legal technicalities delayed the arrival of the case at Federal Court of Justice, the highest court for civil and criminal cases.
The appeal was formally received on March 22, said Erna Besirovic, a justice official at the court, in Karlsruhe.
“The case is pending,” she said, with no date set for a hearing or other action.
